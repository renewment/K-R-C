int array[5][10]; -> a 5x10 int array

to create a pointer points to this array, we can write:
   int (*p)[10] = array;, which means that p is a pointer point to a 1-d array whose
   length is 10. Then we can use p like a normal array, ex: p[1][2] = 5;

   we can also define pointer by int (*p)[5][10] = &array;, which means that p
   is a pointer point to a 2-d 5x10 array. then we can operate with p by
   (*p)[1][2] = 5;
